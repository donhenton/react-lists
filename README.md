# React Lists

Demonstration of :

* using postal for react communication
* reusable modal
* using request response to query state storage


### Running locally

* gulp dev
* http://127.0.0.1:8080

 

 
## gh-pages
uses 'gulp release --production' to update the public_html folder

https://donhenton.github.io/react-lists/public_html/

Routing on gh-pages uses window.location.pathname in the navcomponent and routes to handle that local development has a path of '/' where gh-pages has a path of '/react-lists/public_html/'
